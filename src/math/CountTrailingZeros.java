		 * 
		 * The idea behind this to count no of 5s in the  factorial
		 * as we know only 2*5 produce 0's in the product or  there 
		 * factors so if we count 2s factors or 5 factor of a number
		 * we can easily find the leading zeros but we wont take 2 
		 * as count reason is there are  large no of factors of 2 so 
		 * we took 5 instead of 2.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Ex:-> let number is 10
		 * 
		 * factorial of 10 -> 1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10 = 3628800
		 * 		There are 2 zeros in the factorial
		 * 		
		 * 		and we can see in the left size there is 
		 * 				2s factor= 2 , 4 ,6 , 8 ,10
		 * 				5s factor= 5 ,10
		 * 			
		 * 			And there is exactly 2 trailing zeros in the factorial
		 * 			
		 * 			so if we divide the given number to 5 factors we can get
		 * 			  no of zeros
		 * 				
		 * 			No of zeros = [no/5]+[no/(5*5)]+[no/(5*5*5)].....
		 * 						Until 5's factor greater then the number itself
		 *
